Iâ€™m a Unity game programmer with more than 3 years of experience using the engine and a strong desire to develop and test new technologies and diverse projects.

I am open to opportunities that will allow me to develop my skills as a professional in the industry. My goal is to join a company working on exciting projects that will challenge my ability to create scalable and maintainable systems.

I collaborated  with Team Garden, an independent studio in Barcelona where I helped them to develop multiple games being the main one [Garden World](https://www.gardenworldgame.com/), an AA game made with Unity. Within the team, I worked on implementing closed extensible systems, finalizing existing systems, and helping to develop some in-house technologies, all while collaborating with game designers and other programmers.

In my free time, I dedicate myself to creating my own small projects that range from video games to tools to facilitate video game development. And more recently, I am exploring the world of the AI to search for a process that works in a video game development to improve results.

I have strong knowledge of C# and the Unity engine, but I have also worked with Java and Python. I have developed both desktop and mobile applications, and I apply best practices when writing code, including using version control systems like Git or Subversion, applying SOLID principles, design patterns and clean code practices.
