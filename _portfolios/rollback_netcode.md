## Description
This is a package for Unity 2021 and **NetcodeForGameObjects** 1.0 that adds rollback netcode for a project.
The reason I did this library is because NetcodeForGameObjects and similar network frameworks don't have rollback netcode support and I wanted to make a simple library to avoid having to use external C++ libraries like GGPO.
Currently still in **alpha** version so expect bugs
