## Fast & Fractured Demo is LIVE!

I'm excited to announce that the first demo version of **Fast & Fractured**, developed by the CEVR-ICALES team, was released on **May 23rd**!

This version features the core single-player experience, pitting you against up to 11 AI contenders in a chaotic, physics-based driving shooter set in a vibrant, stereotypical Spanish village. While the multiplayer mode is still a work-in-progress, you can dive into the mayhem right now and experience the unique charm and frenetic gameplay we've been working on.

### Version Info:
*   **Release Date:** May 23rd, 2025
*   **Current Features:** Single-player free-for-all against AI opponents, 4 distinct drivers with unlockable skins, physics-based combat, and a unique Spanish village map.
*   **Multiplayer:** Currently in development and not included in this demo version.

Step into the driver's seat and cause some chaos! Pick your favorite local and get ready for some vehicular pandemonium.
