I am a Unity video game programmer with 3
years of experience using it.
I am open to
opportunities that allow me to develop my
skills as a professional in the industry.
I always search for new technology to try in my free times and side projects and if didn't exist I will make it myself!

Currently, I am doing an internship at Team
Garden, an indie studio based in Barcelona that
develops an AA game called [Garden World](https://www.gardenworldgame.com/).
I joined the team to help them to implement
closed extensible systems and finalize existing
systems too.
