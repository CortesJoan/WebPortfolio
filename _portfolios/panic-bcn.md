## My work here

In this project I had more room to make a flexible code that in the other collaborations. That means that I had a large abstraction layer and I could setup the foundations in the code structure of the project. .

### Enemy Behaviors and AI

I implemented and refined various enemy behaviors, including movement, patrolling, attacking, and responding to player actions. I also made the 3 original variations that each basic enemy had in the original game.

### Player Mechanics and Abilities

I worked on core player mechanics such as movement, jumping, basic attacks, and the ultimate attack. This included scripting features like combo handling, invulnerability during blinking, and health management.

### Fruit system

I designed and implemented the fruit system, including both large and small fruits with different point values and behaviors. I also made the script for splitting big fruits into small ones.

### Projectile System

I developed the projectile system, including scripting the movement and behavior of projectiles.

### Health and Damage System

I implemented the health and damage system for both players and enemies. The logic is easily reusable by any player or any enemy.

### Scoring System

I developed the scoring system, independent for each player, to make them able to save their own scores. The display and logic are correctly decoupled.

### Basic level prototyping

I made some basic level prototyping to test the mechanics and the gameplay. I also made some basic level design and adjusted some tools to make it easier to make levels for the level designers.

### Improved project structure as a whole

As I said, I had plenty of freedom to refactor and optimize the already existing codebase, improving code structure, readability, and performance as well as fixing some bugs. 

### Other Contributions

I can not talk too much about these other contributions, but I also worked on some aspects of the game that are exclusively new for this remake.

My work at PanicBCN remake was a great opportunity to showcase my skills and contribute to a fun and challenging game. I am proud of the work I did and am excited to see the final product released to the public.
