I am a Unity video game programmer with more than 3 years of experience using it.
I am open toopportunities that allow me to develop my skills as a professional in the industry.
I always search for new technology to try in my free times and side projects and if didn't exist I will make it myself!

Currently, I am doing a collaboration at TeamGarden, an indie studio based in Barcelona that
develops an AA game called [Garden World](https://www.gardenworldgame.com/).
I joined the team to help them to implement closed extensible systems and finalize existingsystems too.
